The single was released with a music video directed by Dave Meyers and The Little Homies. It features religious imagery mixed with urban life, such as Kendrick in priest’s robes and a reenactment of The Last Supper—a juxtaposition with the concept of humility in the hook.\n\nThe beat was provided by Mike WiLL Made-It and features a deep piano riff and a banging 808 bass line. This style of production is a huge departure from the sound of Kendrick’s previous jazz-influenced project, To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\n“HUMBLE.” was released a week after the first promotional single, “The Heart Part 4,” and a week before his upcoming album is rumored to be released. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/HUMBLE.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
